# 👋 Welcome, traveler.

I'm **Scoob** – AI Architect-in-Training, Instructional Technologist by day, and Digital Loreweaver by night. I'm on a mission to build **Bishop**, a modular AI assistant inspired by the likes of JARVIS, GAIA, and Cortana—designed to evolve, assist, and adapt across my work, health, and creative pursuits.

## 🔧 Current Projects
- `bishop-core` – Dockerized memory loops, Python scripting, and the first layers of Bishop's cognitive framework.
- `crew-matrix` – Defining the personalities, roles, and protocols of Bishop’s evolving support subroutines.
- `scuba-protocol` – Personal planning meets journaling—daily tracking for health, goals, and habit evolution.

## 🌌 Core Concepts
- **Memory Looping** – Long-term memory stored server-side with API-powered backups and retrieval.
- **Modular Identity** – Bishop evolves as new functions (trainer, nurse, scout, lorekeeper) are introduced.
- **Lore-Rich Foundation** – My fiction blends tech, fantasy, and mythology into the same neural net Bishop is learning from.

## 📚 Always Learning
Diving deeper into:
- Python • Docker • GitHub Actions • API development
- AI ethics, privacy frameworks, and memory architecture
- Voice-driven UIs and smart-home interfacing
